# MTADelayBotHeroku
This is the project I did as a Data Science Fellow at Insight Data Science, predicting the delay times on the New York MTA. 

The code is the algorithm I used to clean feature engineer historical Twitter data which I scraped from the New York MTA 
Twitter account, and predic tdelay times. The MTA Twitter data was streamed to a bot hosted on Heroku, which processed 
the data and ran it through the model. The prediction was then posted on another Twitter account, the details of which can
be found in the YouTube link in this repository.
